title predictive active set selection methods gaussian processes authors ricardo henao ole winther abstract propose active set selection framework gaussian process classification cases dataset large enough render inference prohibitive scheme consists two step alternating procedure active set update rules hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal likelihood maximization active set update rules rely ability predictive distributions gaussian process classifier estimate relative contribution datapoint either included removed model means use include points potentially high impact classifier decision process removing less relevant introduce two active set rules based different criteria first one prefers model interpretable active set parameters whereas second puts computational complexity first thus model active set parameters directly control complexity also provide theoretical empirical support active set selection strategy good approximation full gaussian process classifier extensive experiments show approach compete state art classification techniques reasonable time complexity source code publicly available http cogsys imm dtu dk passgp
