title debugging tool localizing faulty processes message passing programs authors masao okita fumihiko ino kenichi hagihara abstract message passing programs process terminates unexpected error terminated process propagate error rest processes communication dependencies resulting program failure therefore locate faults developers must identify group processes involved original error faulty processes activate faults paper presents novel debugging tool named mpi predebugger mpi pd localizing faulty processes message passing programs mpi pd automatically distinguishes original propagated errors checking communication errors program execution mpi pd observes communication errors backtraces communication dependencies points potential faulty processes timeline view also introduce three case studies mpi pd shown play key role debugging studies believe mpi pd helps developers locate faults allows concentrate correcting programs
