title linear time feature selection regularized least squares authors tapio pahikkala antti airola tapio salakoski abstract propose novel algorithm greedy forward feature selection regularized least squares rls regression classification also known least squares support vector machine ridge regression algorithm call greedy rls starts empty feature set iteration adds feature whose addition provides best leave one cross validation performance method considerably faster previously proposed ones since time complexity linear number training examples number features original data set desired size set selected features therefore side effect obtain new training algorithm learning sparse linear rls predictors used large scale learning speed possible due matrix calculus based short cuts leave one feature addition experimentally demonstrate scalability algorithm ability find good quality feature sets
