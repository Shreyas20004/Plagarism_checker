title efficient probabilistic top left corner parsing authors brian roark mark johnson abstract paper examines efficient predictive broad coverage parsing without dynamic programming contrast bottom methods depth first top parsing produces partial parses fully connected trees spanning entire left context kind non local dependency partial semantic interpretation principle read contrast two predictive parsing approaches top left corner parsing find viable addition find enhancement non local information improves parser accuracy also substantially improves search efficiency
