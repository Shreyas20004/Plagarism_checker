title compact non left recursive grammars using selective left corner transform factoring authors mark johnson brian roark abstract left corner transform removes left recursion probabilistic context free grammars unification grammars permitting simple top parsing techniques used unfortunately grammars produced standard left corner transform usually much larger original selective left corner transform described paper produces transformed grammar simulates left corner recognition user specified set original productions top recognition others combined two factorizations produces non left recursive grammars much larger original
