title towards flexible teamwork authors tambe abstract many ai researchers today striving build agent teams complex dynamic multi agent domains intended applications arenas education training entertainment information integration collective robotics unfortunately uncertainties complex dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork particular team members often encounter differing incomplete possibly inconsistent views environment furthermore team members unexpectedly fail fulfilling responsibilities discover unexpected opportunities highly flexible coordination communication key addressing uncertainties simply fitting individual agents precomputed coordination plans inflexibility cause severe failures teamwork domain specificity hinders reusability central hypothesis key flexibility reusability providing agents general models teamwork agents exploit models autonomously reason coordination communication providing requisite flexibility furthermore models enable reuse across domains saving implementation effort enforcing consistency article presents one general implemented model teamwork called steam basic building block teamwork steam joint intentions cohen levesque b teamwork steam based agents building partial hierarchy joint intentions hierarchy seen parallel grosz kraus partial sharedplans furthermore steam team members monitor team individual members performance reorganizing team necessary finally decision theoretic communication selectivity steam ensures reduction communication overheads teamwork appropriate sensitivity environmental conditions article describes steam application three different complex domains presents detailed empirical results
