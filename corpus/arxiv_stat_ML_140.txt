title theoretical properties overlapping groups lasso authors daniel percival abstract present two sets theoretical results grouped lasso overlap jacob obozinski vert linear regression setting method allows joint selection predictors sparse regression allowing complex structured sparsity predictors encoded set groups flexible framework suggests arbitrarily complex structures encoded intricate set groups results show strategy results unexpected theoretical consequences procedure particular give two sets results finite sample bounds prediction estimation asymptotic distribution selection sets results give insight consequences choosing increasingly complex set groups procedure well happens set groups cannot recover true sparsity pattern additionally results demonstrate differences similarities grouped lasso procedure without overlapping groups analysis shows set groups must chosen caution overly complex set groups damage analysis
