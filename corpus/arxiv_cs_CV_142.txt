title handwritten farsi character recognition using artificial neural network authors reza gharoie ahangar mohammad farajpoor ahangar abstract neural networks used character recognition last many years work confined english character recognition till date little work reported handwritten farsi character recognition paper made attempt recognize handwritten farsi characters using multilayer perceptron one hidden layer error backpropagation algorithm used train mlp network addition analysis carried determine number hidden nodes achieve high performance backpropagation network recognition handwritten farsi characters system trained using several different forms handwriting provided male female participants different age groups finally rigorous training results automatic hcr system using mlp network work experiments carried two hundred fifty samples five writers results showed mlp networks trained error backpropagation algorithm superior recognition accuracy memory usage result indicates backpropagation network provides good recognition accuracy handwritten farsi characters
