title sparse group restricted boltzmann machines authors heng luo ruimin shen cahngyong niu abstract since learning typically slow boltzmann machines need restrict connections within hidden layers however resulting states hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies based observation propose using l l regularization upon activation possibilities hidden units restricted boltzmann machines capture loacal dependencies among hidden units regularization encourages hidden units many groups inactive given observed data also makes hidden units within group compete modeling observed data thus l l regularization rbms yields sparsity group hidden unit levels call rbms trained regularizer emph sparse group rbms proposed sparse group rbms applied three tasks modeling patches natural images modeling handwritten digits pretaining deep networks classification task furthermore illustrate regularizer also applied deep boltzmann machines lead sparse group deep boltzmann machines adapted mnist data set two layer sparse group boltzmann machine achieves error rate knowledge best published result permutation invariant version mnist task
