title finding exogenous variables data many variables observations authors shohei shimizu takashi washio aapo hyvarinen seiya imoto abstract many statistical methods proposed estimate causal models classical situations fewer variables observations p n p number variables n number observations however modern datasets including gene expression data need high dimensional causal modeling challenging situations orders magnitude variables observations p n paper propose method find exogenous variables linear non gaussian causal model requires much smaller sample sizes conventional methods works even p n key idea identify variables exogenous based non gaussianity instead estimating entire structure model exogenous variables work triggers activate causal chain model identification leads efficient experimental designs better understanding causal mechanism present experiments artificial data real world gene expression data evaluate method
