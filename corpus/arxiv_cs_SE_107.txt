title prioritizing software inspection results using static profiling authors cathal boogerd leon moonen abstract static software checking tools useful additional automated software inspection step easily integrated development cycle assist creating secure reliable high quality code however often quoted disadvantage tools generate overly large number warnings including many false positives due approximate analysis techniques information overload effectively limits usefulness paper present elan technique helps user prioritize information generated software inspection tool based demand driven computation likelihood execution reaches locations warnings reported analysis orthogonal prioritization techniques known literature severity levels statistical analysis reduce false positives evaluate feasibility technique using number case studies assess quality predictions comparing actual values obtained dynamic profiling
