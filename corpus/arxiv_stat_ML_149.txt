title joint estimation linear non gaussian acyclic models authors shohei shimizu abstract linear non gaussian structural equation model called lingam identifiable model exploratory causal analysis previous methods estimate causal ordering variables connection strengths based single dataset however many application domains data obtained different conditions multiple datasets obtained rather single dataset paper present new method jointly estimate multiple lingams assumption models share causal ordering may different connection strengths differently distributed variables simulations new method estimates models accurately estimating separately
