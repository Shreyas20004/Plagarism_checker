title principled approach towards symbolic geometric constraint satisfaction authors bhansali g kramer j hoar abstract important problem geometric reasoning find configuration collection geometric bodies satisfy set given constraints recently suggested problem solved efficiently symbolically reasoning geometry approach called degrees freedom analysis employs set specialized routines called plan fragments specify change configuration set bodies satisfy new constraint preserving existing constraints potential drawback limits scalability approach concerned difficulty writing plan fragments paper address limitation showing plan fragments automatically synthesized using first principles geometric bodies actions topology
