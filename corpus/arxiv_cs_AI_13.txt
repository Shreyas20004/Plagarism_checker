title random worlds maximum entropy authors j grove j halpern koller abstract given knowledge base kb containing first order statistical facts consider principled method called random worlds method computing degree belief formula phi holds given kb reasoning world system consisting n individuals consider possible worlds first order models domain n satisfy kb compute fraction phi true define degree belief asymptotic value fraction n grows large show vocabulary underlying phi kb uses constants unary predicates naturally associate entropy world n grows larger many worlds higher entropy therefore use maximum entropy computation compute degree belief result similar spirit previous work physics artificial intelligence far general equal interest result limitations scope importantly restriction unary predicates seems necessary although random worlds method makes sense general connection maximum entropy seems disappear non unary case observations suggest unexpected limitations applicability maximum entropy methods
