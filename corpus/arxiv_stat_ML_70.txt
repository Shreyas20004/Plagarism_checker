title sparse convolved multiple output gaussian processes authors mauricio lvarez neil lawrence abstract recently increasing interest methods deal multiple outputs motivated partly frameworks like multitask learning multisensor networks structured output data gaussian processes perspective problem reduces specifying appropriate covariance function whilst positive semi definite captures dependencies data points across outputs one approach account non trivial correlations outputs employs convolution processes latent function interpretation convolution transform establish dependencies output variables main drawbacks approach associated computational storage demands paper address issues present different sparse approximations dependent output gaussian processes constructed convolution formalism exploit conditional independencies present naturally model leads form covariance similar spirit called pitc fitc approximations single output show experimental results synthetic real data particular show results pollution prediction school exams score prediction gene expression data
