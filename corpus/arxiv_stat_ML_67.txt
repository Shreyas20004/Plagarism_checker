title distinguishing cause effect via second order exponential models authors dominik janzing xiaohai sun bernhard schoelkopf abstract propose method infer causal structures containing discrete continuous variables idea select causal hypotheses conditional density every variable given causes becomes smooth define family smooth densities conditional densities second order exponential models e maximizing conditional entropy subject first second statistical moments variables take values proper subsets r n conditionals induce different families joint distributions even markov equivalent graphs consider case one binary one real valued variable method distinguish cause effect using example describe sometimes causal hypothesis must rejected p effect cause p cause share algorithmic information untypical chosen independently way method spirit faithfulness based causal inference also rejects non generic mutual adjustments among dag parameters
