title deformable model complexity independent image resolution authors jacques olivier lachaud benjamin taton abstract present parametric deformable model recovers image components complexity independent resolution input images proposed model also automatically changes topology remains fully compatible general framework deformable models precisely image space equipped metric expands salient image details according strength curvature whole evolution model sampling contour kept regular respect metric way vertex density reduced along parts curve high quality shape representation preserved complexity deformable model thus improved longer influenced feature preserving changes resolution input images building metric requires prior estimation contour curvature obtained using robust estimator investigates local variations orientation image gradient experimental results computer generated biomedical images presented illustrate advantages approach
