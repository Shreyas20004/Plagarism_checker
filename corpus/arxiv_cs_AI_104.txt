title reusable iterative optimization software library solve combinatorial problems approximate reasoning authors andreas raggl wolfgang slany abstract real world combinatorial optimization problems scheduling typically complex solve exact methods additionally problems often observe vaguely specified constraints different importance available data may uncertain compromises antagonistic criteria may necessary present combination approximate reasoning based constraints iterative optimization based heuristics help model solve problems framework c software libraries called starflip initially developed schedule continuous caster units steel plants present paper results reusing library components shift scheduling system workforce industrial production plant
