title efficient iris recognition improvement feature extraction subset selection authors amir azizi hamid reza pourreza abstract selection optimal feature subset classification become important issue field iris recognition paper propose several methods iris feature subset selection vector creation deterministic feature sequence extracted iris image using contourlet transform technique contourlet transform captures intrinsic geometrical structures iris image decomposes iris image set directional sub bands texture details captured different orientations various scales reducing feature vector dimensions use method extract significant bit information normalized iris images method ignore fragile bits finally use svm support vector machine classifier approximating amount people identification proposed system experimental result show proposed method reduces processing time increase classification accuracy also iris feature vector length much smaller versus methods
