title muse csp extension constraint satisfaction problem authors r helzerman p harper abstract paper describes extension constraint satisfaction problem csp called muse csp multiply segmented constraint satisfaction problem extension especially useful problems segment multiple sets partially shared variables problems arise naturally signal processing applications including computer vision speech processing handwriting recognition applications often difficult segment data one way given low level information utilized segmentation algorithms muse csp used compactly represent several similar instances constraint satisfaction problem multiple instances csp common variables domains constraints combined single instance muse csp reducing work required apply constraints introduce concepts muse node consistency muse arc consistency muse path consistency demonstrate muse csp used compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences multiple sentence hypotheses often generated speech recognition algorithms grammar constraints used provide parses syntactically correct sentences algorithms muse arc path consistency provided finally discuss create muse csp set csps labeled indicate variable shared single csp
