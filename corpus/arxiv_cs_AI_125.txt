title cc golog towards realistic logic based robot controllers authors henrik grosskreutz gerhard lakemeyer abstract high level robot controllers realistic domains typically deal processes operate concurrently change world continuously execution actions event driven charge batteries soon voltage level low non logic based robot control languages well suited express scenarios fare poorly comes projecting conspicuous way world evolves actions executed hand logic based control language like congolog based situation calculus well suited latter however problems expressing event driven behavior paper show problems overcome first extending situation calculus support continuous change event driven behavior presenting ccgolog variant congolog based extended situation calculus one benefit ccgolog narrows gap expressiveness compared non logic based control languages preserving semantically well founded projection mechanism
