title connectionist theory refinement genetically searching space network topologies authors w opitz j w shavlik abstract algorithm learns set examples ideally able exploit available resources abundant computing power b domain specific knowledge improve ability generalize connectionist theory refinement systems use background knowledge select neural network topology initial weights proven effective exploiting domain specific knowledge however exploit available computing power weakness occurs lack ability refine topology neural networks produce thereby limiting generalization especially given impoverished domain theories present regent algorithm uses domain specific knowledge help create initial population knowledge based neural networks b genetic operators crossover mutation specifically designed knowledge based networks continually search better network topologies experiments three real world domains indicate new algorithm able significantly increase generalization compared standard connectionist theory refinement system well previous algorithm growing knowledge based networks
