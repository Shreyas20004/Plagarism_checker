title bidirectional heuristic search reconsidered authors h kaindl g kainz abstract assessment bidirectional heuristic search incorrect since first published quarter century ago quite long time search strategy achieve expected results major misunderstanding reasons behind although still wide spread belief bidirectional heuristic search afflicted problem search frontiers passing demonstrate conjecture wrong based finding present new generic approach bidirectional heuristic search new approach dynamically improving heuristic values feasible bidirectional search approaches put perspective traditional recently proposed approaches order facilitate better overall understanding empirical results experiments new approaches show bidirectional heuristic search performed efficiently also limited memory results suggest bidirectional heuristic search appears better solving certain difficult problems corresponding unidirectional search provides evidence usefulness search strategy long neglected summary show bidirectional heuristic search viable consequently propose reconsidered
