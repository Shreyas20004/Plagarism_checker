title additive kernels gaussian process modeling authors nicolas durrande david ginsbourger olivier roustant abstract gaussian process gp models often used mathematical approximations computationally expensive experiments provided kernel suitably chosen enough data available obtain reasonable fit simulator gp model beneficially used tasks prediction optimization monte carlo based quantification uncertainty however former conditions become unrealistic using classical gps dimension input increases one popular alternative turn generalized additive models gams relying assumption simulator response approximately decomposed sum univariate functions approach successfully applied approximation nevertheless completely compatible gp framework versatile applications ambition present work give insight use gps additive models integrating additivity within kernel proposing parsimonious numerical method data driven parameter estimation first part article deals kernels naturally associated additive processes properties gp models based kernels second part dedicated numerical procedure based relaxation additive kernel parameter estimation finally efficiency proposed method illustrated compared approaches sobol g function
