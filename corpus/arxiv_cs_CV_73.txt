title view based methods achieve bayes optimal recognition authors thomas breuel abstract paper proves visual object recognition systems using euclidean similarity measurements compare object views previously seen views achieve recognition performance observers access coordinate information able using arbitrary models internally furthermore demonstrates systems require training views bayes optimal model based systems building computer vision systems results imply using view based appearance based techniques carefully constructed combination evidence mechanisms may disadvantage relative model based systems computational approaches human vision show impossible distinguish view based model based techniques object recognition solely comparing performance achievable human model based systems
