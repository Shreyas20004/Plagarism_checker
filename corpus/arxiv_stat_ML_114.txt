title exact block wise optimization group lasso sparse group lasso linear regression authors rina foygel mathias drton abstract group lasso penalized regression method used regression problems covariates partitioned groups promote sparsity group level existing methods finding group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods update entire coefficient vector simultaneously step update one group coefficients time using inexact line search approximate optimal value group coefficients groups coefficients fixed present new method computation group lasso linear regression case single line search sls algorithm operates computing exact optimal value group coefficients fixed one univariate line search perform simulations demonstrating sls algorithm often efficient existing computational methods also extend sls algorithm sparse group lasso problem via signed single line search ssls algorithm give theoretical results support algorithms
