title iterative deepening branch bound authors mohanty r n behera abstract tree search problem best first search algorithm needs much space remove drawbacks algorithms ida developed space time cost efficient ida give optimal solution real valued problems like flow shop scheduling travelling salesman knapsack due real valued cost estimates thus modifications done iterative deepening branch bound search algorithms developed meets requirements tried using algorithm flow shop scheduling problem found quite effective
