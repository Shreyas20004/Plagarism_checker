title laplacian support vector machines trained primal authors stefano melacci mikhail belkin abstract last years due growing ubiquity unlabeled data much effort spent machine learning community develop better understanding improve quality classifiers exploiting unlabeled data following manifold regularization approach laplacian support vector machines lapsvms shown state art performance semi supervised classification paper present two strategies solve primal lapsvm problem order overcome issues original dual formulation whereas training lapsvm dual requires two steps using primal form allows us collapse training single step moreover computational complexity training algorithm reduced n n using preconditioned conjugate gradient n combined number labeled unlabeled examples speed training using early stopping strategy based prediction unlabeled data available labeled validation examples allows algorithm quickly compute approximate solutions roughly classification accuracy optimal ones considerably reducing training time due simplicity training lapsvm primal starting point additional enhancements original lapsvm formulation dealing large datasets present extensive experimental evaluation real world data showing benefits proposed approach
