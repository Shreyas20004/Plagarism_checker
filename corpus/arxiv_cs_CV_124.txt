title adaptive regularization ill posed problems application non rigid image registration authors andriy myronenko xubo song abstract introduce adaptive regularization approach contrast conventional tikhonov regularization specifies fixed regularization operator estimate simultaneously parameters bayesian perspective estimate prior distribution parameters assuming close given model distribution constrain prior distribution gauss markov random field gmrf allows us solve prior distribution analytically provides fast optimization algorithm apply approach non rigid image registration estimate spatial transformation two images evaluation shows adaptive regularization approach significantly outperforms standard variational methods
