title multi label mrf optimization via least squares cuts authors ghassan hamarneh abstract many applications graph cuts computer vision e g segmentation present novel method reformulate np hard k way graph partitioning problem approximate minimal graph cut problem globally optimal solution found polynomial time non terminal vertex original graph replaced set ceil log k new vertices original graph edges replaced new edges connecting new vertices two source sink terminal nodes weights new edges obtained using novel least squares solution approximating constraints initial k way setup minimal cut labels new vertex binary vs gray encoding decoded decimal label number assigns original vertices one k classes analyze properties approximation present quantitative well qualitative segmentation results
