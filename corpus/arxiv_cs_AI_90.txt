title gravity fails local search topology authors j frank p cheeseman j stutz abstract local search algorithms combinatorial search problems frequently encounter sequence states impossible improve value objective function moves regions called plateau moves dominate time spent local search analyze characterize plateaus three different classes randomly generated boolean satisfiability problems identify several interesting features plateaus impact performance local search algorithms show local minima tend small occasionally may large also show local minima escaped without unsatisfying large number clauses systematically searching escape route may computationally expensive local minimum large show plateaus exits called benches tend much larger minima benches exit states local search use escape show solutions e global minima randomly generated problem instances form clusters behave similarly local minima revisit several enhancements local search algorithms explain performance light results finally discuss strategies creating next generation local search algorithms
