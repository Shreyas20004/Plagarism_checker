title directlingam direct method learning linear non gaussian structural equation model authors shohei shimizu takanori inazumi yasuhiro sogawa aapo hyvarinen yoshinobu kawahara takashi washio patrik hoyer kenneth bollen abstract structural equation models bayesian networks widely used analyze causal relations continuous variables frameworks linear acyclic models typically used model data generating process variables recently shown use non gaussianity identifies full structure linear acyclic model e causal ordering variables connection strengths without using prior knowledge network structure case conventional methods however existing estimation methods based iterative search algorithms may converge correct solution finite number steps paper propose new direct method estimate causal ordering connection strengths based non gaussianity contrast previous methods algorithm requires algorithmic parameters guaranteed converge right solution within small fixed number steps data strictly follows model
