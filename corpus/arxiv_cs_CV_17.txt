title analytical piecewise radial distortion model precision camera calibration authors lili yangquan chen kevin l moore abstract common approach radial distortion means polynomial approximation introduces distortion specific parameters camera model requires estimation distortion parameters task estimating radial distortion find radial distortion model allows easy undistortion well satisfactory accuracy paper presents new piecewise radial distortion model easy analytical undistortion formula motivation seeking piecewise radial distortion model camera resulted low quality manufacturing nonlinear radial distortion complex using low order polynomials approximate radial distortion might precise enough hand higher order polynomials suffer inverse problem new piecewise radial distortion function flexibility obtained radial undistortion performed analytically experimental results presented show new piecewise radial distortion model better performance achieved using single function furthermore comparable performance conventional polynomial model using coefficients also accomplished
