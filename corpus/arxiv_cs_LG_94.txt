title entropy perception relativity authors stefan jaeger abstract paper expand shannon definition entropy new form entropy allows integration information different random events shannon notion entropy special case general definition entropy define probability using called performance function de facto exponential distribution assuming general notion entropy reflects true uncertainty probabilistic event understand perceived uncertainty differs claim perception result two opposing forces similar two famous antagonists chinese philosophy yin yang based idea show perceived uncertainty matches true uncertainty points determined golden ratio demonstrate well known sigmoid function typically employ artificial neural networks non linear threshold function describes actual performance furthermore provide motivation time dilation einstein special relativity basically claiming although time dilation conforms perception correspond reality end paper show apply theoretical framework practical applications present recognition rates pattern recognition problem also propose network architecture take advantage general entropy solve complex decision problems
