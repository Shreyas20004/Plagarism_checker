title kernels measures defined gram matrix support authors marco cuturi abstract present work new family kernels compare positive measures arbitrary spaces xcal endowed positive kernel kappa translates naturally kernels histograms clouds points first cover case xcal euclidian focus kernels take account variance matrix mixture two measures compute similarity kernels define semigroup kernels sense use sum two measures compare spectral sense use eigenspectrum variance matrix mixture show family kernels close bonds laplace transforms nonnegative valued functions defined cone positive semidefinite matrices present closed formulas derived special cases integral expressions focusing functions invariant addition null eigenvalue spectrum variance matrix define kernels atomic measures arbitrary spaces xcal endowed kernel kappa using directly eigenvalues centered gram matrix joined support compared measures provide explicit formulas suited applications present preliminary experiments illustrate interest approach
