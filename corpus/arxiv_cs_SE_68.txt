title event based program analysis dewiz authors ch schaubschlaeger kranzlmueller j volkert abstract due increased complexity parallel distributed programs debugging considered difficult time consuming part software lifecycle tool support hence crucial necessity hide complexity user however existing tools seem inadequate soon program consideration exploits processors long execution time problem addressed novel debugging tool dewiz debugging wizard whose focus lies scalability dewiz modular scalable architecture uses event graph model representation investigated program dewiz provides set modules combined generate analyze visualize event graph data within processing pipeline toolset tries extract useful information presented user arbitrary level abstraction additionally dewiz framework used easily implement arbitrary user defined modules
