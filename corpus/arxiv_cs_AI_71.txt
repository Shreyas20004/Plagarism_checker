title exploiting causal independence bayesian network inference authors n l zhang poole abstract new method proposed exploiting causal independencies exact bayesian network inference bayesian network viewed representing factorization joint probability multiplication set conditional probabilities present notion causal independence enables one factorize conditional probabilities combination even smaller factors consequently obtain finer grain factorization joint probability new formulation causal independence lets us specify conditional probability variable given parents terms associative commutative operator sum max contribution parent start simple algorithm bayesian network inference given evidence query variable uses factorization find posterior distribution query show algorithm extended exploit causal independence empirical studies based cpcs networks medical diagnosis show method efficient previous methods allows inference larger networks previous algorithms
