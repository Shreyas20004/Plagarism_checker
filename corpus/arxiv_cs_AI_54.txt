title practical methods proving termination general logic programs authors e marchiori abstract termination logic programs negated body atoms called general logic programs important topic one reason many computational mechanisms used process negated atoms like clark negation failure chan constructive negation based termination conditions paper introduces methodology proving termination general logic programs w r prolog selection rule idea distinguish parts program depending whether termination depends selection rule end notions low weakly acceptable program introduced use notions develop methodology proving termination general logic programs show interesting problems non monotonic reasoning formalized implemented means terminating general logic programs
