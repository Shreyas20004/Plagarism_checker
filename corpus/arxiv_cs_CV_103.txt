title graph based classification multiple observation sets authors effrosyni kokiopoulou pascal frossard abstract consider problem classification object given multiple observations possibly include different transformations possible transformations object generally span low dimensional manifold original signal space propose take advantage manifold structure effective classification object represented observation set particular design low complexity solution able exploit properties data manifolds graph based algorithm hence formulate computation unknown label matrix smoothing process manifold constraint observations represent object one single class results discrete optimization problem solved efficient low complexity algorithm demonstrate performance proposed graph based algorithm classification sets multiple images moreover show high potential video based face recognition outperforms state art solutions fall short exploiting manifold structure face image data sets
