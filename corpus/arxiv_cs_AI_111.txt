title accuracy running time gsat authors deborah east miroslaw truszczynski abstract randomized algorithms deciding satisfiability shown effective solving problems thousands variables however algorithms complete provide guarantee satisfying assignment one exists found thus studying randomized algorithms two important characteristics need considered running time even importantly accuracy measure likelihood satisfying assignment found provided one exists fact argue without reference accuracy notion running time randomized algorithms well defined paper introduce formal notion accuracy use define concept running time use notions study random walk strategy gsat algorithm investigate dependence accuracy properties input formulas clause variable ratio number satisfying assignments demonstrate running time gsat grows exponentially number variables input formula randomly generated cnf formulas formulas encoding colorability graphs
