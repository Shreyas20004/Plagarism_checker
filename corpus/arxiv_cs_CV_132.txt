title augmenting light field model wave optics effects authors se baek oh george barbastathis ramesh raskar abstract ray based light field representation cannot directly used analyze diffractive phase sensitive optical elements paper exploit tools wave optics extend light field representation via novel light field transform introduce key modification ray based model support transform insert virtual light source potentially negative valued radiance certain emitted rays create look table light field transformers canonical optical elements two key conclusions free space light field completely represents wavefront propagation via rays real positive well negative valued radiance ii occluders light field composed light field transformers plus insertion ray based virtual light sources represents resultant phase amplitude wavefronts free space propagation analyze different wavefronts coherence possibilities occluders show light field transform simply based convolution followed multiplication operation formulation brings powerful concepts wave optics computer vision graphics show applications cubic phase plate imaging holographic displays
