title approximating lp distances p authors ping li abstract applications machine learning data mining require computing pairwise lp distances data matrix massive high dimensional data computing pairwise distances infeasible fact even storing pairwise distances memory may also infeasible paper proposes simple method p first decompose l p p even distances sum marginal norms p inner products different orders apply normal sub gaussian random projections approximate resultant inner products assuming marginal norms computed exactly linear scan propose two strategies applying random projections basic projection strategy requires one projection matrix difficult analyze alternative projection strategy requires p projection matrices theoretical analysis much easier terms accuracy least p basic strategy always accurate alternative strategy data non negative common reality
