title sequential anomaly detection presence noise limited feedback authors maxim raginsky rebecca willett corinne horn jorge silva roummel marcia abstract paper describes methodology detecting anomalies sequentially observed potentially noisy data proposed approach consists two main elements em filtering assigning belief likelihood successive measurement based upon ability predict previous noisy observations em hedging flagging potential anomalies comparing current belief time varying data adaptive threshold threshold adjusted based available feedback end user algorithms combine universal prediction recent work online convex programming require computing posterior distributions given current observations involve simple primal dual parameter updates heart proposed approach lie exponential family models used wide variety contexts applications yield methods achieve sublinear per round regret static slowly varying product distributions marginals drawn exponential family moreover regret static distributions coincides minimax value corresponding online strongly convex game also prove bounds number mistakes made hedging step relative best offline choice threshold access estimated beliefs feedback signals validate theory synthetic data drawn time varying distribution binary vectors high dimensionality well enron email dataset
