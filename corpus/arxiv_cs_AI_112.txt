title syntactic autonomy autonomy without symbols self organization might evolve authors luis rocha abstract two different types agency discussed based dynamically coherent incoherent couplings environment respectively propose private syntax syntactic autonomy discovered dynamically coherent agents significant interesting types closure autonomy syntactic autonomy established process description based selected self organization open ended evolution enabled stage agents depend addition dynamics localized symbolic memory thus adding level dynamical incoherence interaction environment furthermore appearance syntactic autonomy enables much interesting types closures amongst agents share syntax investigate study emergence syntax dynamical systems experiments cellular automata leading emergent computation solve non trivial tasks discussed rna editing also mentioned process may used obtain primordial biological code necessary open ended evolution
