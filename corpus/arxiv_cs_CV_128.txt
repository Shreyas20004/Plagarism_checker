title new approach digit recognition based hand gesture analysis authors ahmed ben jmaa walid mahdi yousra ben jemaa abdelmajid ben hamadou abstract present paper new approach hand gesture analysis allows digit recognition analysis based extracting set features hand image combining using induction graph important features extract image fingers locations heights distance pair fingers approach consists three steps hand detection localization ii fingers extraction iii features identification combination digit recognition input image assumed contain one person thus apply fuzzy classifier identify skin pixels finger extraction step attempt remove hand components except fingers process based hand anatomy properties final step consists representing histogram detected fingers order extract features used digit recognition approach invariant scale rotation translation hand experiments undertaken show effectiveness proposed approach
