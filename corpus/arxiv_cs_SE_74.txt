title rigorous design tracers experiment constraint logic programming authors mireille ducasse ludovic langevine pierre deransart abstract order design implement tracers one must decide exactly trace produce trace one hand trace designs often guided implementation concerns useful hand interesting trace cannot produced efficiently useful either article propose methodology helps efficiently produce accurate traces firstly design formal specification trace model secondly derive prototype tracer specification thirdly analyze produced traces fourthly implement efficient tracer lastly compare traces two tracers step problems found case one iterate process successfully applied proposed methodology design implementation real tracer constraint logic programming able efficiently generate information required build interesting graphical views executions
