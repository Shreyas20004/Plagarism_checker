title bounding probability error high precision recognition authors andrew kae gary b huang erik learned miller abstract consider models important early processing estimate variables high precision perhaps relatively low rates recall variables identified near certainty conditioned upon allowing inference done efficiently specifically consider optical character recognition ocr systems bootstrapped identifying subset correctly translated document words high precision clean set subsequently used document specific training data many current ocr systems produce measures confidence identity letter word thresholding confidence values even high values still produces errors introduce novel technique identifying set correct words high precision rather estimating posterior probabilities bound probability given word incorrect general assumptions using approximate worst case analysis result parameters model nearly irrelevant able identify subset words even noisy documents highly confident set documents able identify words average without making single error ability produce word lists high precision allows us use family models depends upon clean word lists
