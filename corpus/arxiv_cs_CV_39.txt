title multilevel thresholding image segmentation fast statistical recursive algorithm authors siddharth arora jayadev acharya amit verma prasanta k panigrahi abstract novel algorithm proposed segmenting image multiple levels using mean variance starting extreme pixel values ends histogram plot algorithm applied recursively sub ranges computed previous step find threshold level new sub range next step significant improvement image quality achieved method makes use fact number distributions tend towards dirac delta function peaking mean limiting condition vanishing variance procedure naturally provides variable size segmentation bigger blocks near extreme pixel values finer divisions around mean chosen value better visualization experiments variety images show new algorithm effectively segments image computationally less time
