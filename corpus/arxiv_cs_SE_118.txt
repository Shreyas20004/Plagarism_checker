title capabilities engineering constructing change tolerant systems authors ramya ravichandar james arthur shawn bohner abstract propose capabilities based approach building long lived complex systems lengthy development cycles user needs technology evolve extended development periods thereby inhibit fixed requirements oriented solution specification effect complex emergent systems traditional approach baselining requirements results unsatisfactory system therefore present alternative approach capabilities engineering mathematically exploits structural semantics function decomposition graph representation user needs formulate capabilities given software system set derived capabilities embodies change tolerant characteristics specifically individual capability functional abstraction constructed highly cohesive minimally coupled neighbors moreover capability set chosen accommodate incremental development approach reflect constraints technology feasibility implementation schedules discuss validation activities empirically prove capabilities based approach results change tolerant systems
