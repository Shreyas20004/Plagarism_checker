title bayesian classification regression high dimensional features authors longhai li abstract thesis responds challenges using large number thousands features regression classification problems two situations high dimensional features arise one high dimensional measurements available example gene expression data produced microarray techniques computational reasons people may select small subset features modelling data looking relevant features predicting response based measure correlation response training data although used commonly procedure make response appear predictable actually chapter propose bayesian method avoid selection bias application naive bayes models mixture models high dimensional features also arise consider high order interactions number parameters increase exponentially order considered chapter propose method compressing group parameters single one exploiting fact many predictor variables derived high order interactions values training cases number compressed parameters may converged considering highest possible order apply compression method logistic sequence prediction models logistic classification models use simulated data real data test methods chapters
