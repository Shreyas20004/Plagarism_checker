title accelerating partial order planners techniques effective search control pruning authors gerevini l schubert abstract propose domain independent techniques bringing well founded partial order planners closer practicality first two techniques aimed improving search control keeping overhead costs low one based simple adjustment default heuristic used ucpop select plans refinement based preferring zero commitment forced plan refinements whenever possible using lifo prioritization otherwise radical technique use operator parameter domains prune search domains initially computed definitions operators initial goal conditions using polynomial time algorithm propagates sets constants operator graph starting initial conditions planning parameter domains used prune nonviable operator instances remove spurious clobbering threats experiments based modifications ucpop improved plan goal selection strategies gave speedups factors ranging variety problems nontrivial unmodified version crucially hardest problems gave greatest improvements pruning technique based parameter domains often gave speedups order magnitude difficult problems default ucpop search strategy improved strategy lisp code techniques test problems provided line appendices
