title gradient vector flow models boundary extraction images authors gilson giraldi leandro marturelli paulo rodrigues abstract gradient vector flow gvf vector diffusion approach based partial differential equations pdes method applied together snake models boundary extraction medical images segmentation key idea use diffusion reaction pde generate new external force field makes snake models less sensitivity initialization well improves snake ability move boundary concavities paper firstly review basic results convergence numerical analysis usual gvf schemes point gvf presents numerical problems due discontinuities image intensity point considered practical viewpoint gvf parameters must follow relationship order improve numerical convergence besides present analytical analysis gvf dependency parameters values also observe method used multiply connected domains imposing suitable boundary condition experimental results verify theoretical points demonstrate utility gvf segmentation approach developed based snakes
