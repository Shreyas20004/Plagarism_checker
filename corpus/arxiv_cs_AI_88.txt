title model approximation scheme planning partially observable stochastic domains authors n l zhang w liu abstract partially observable markov decision processes pomdps natural model planning problems effects actions nondeterministic state world completely observable difficult solve pomdps exactly paper proposes new approximation scheme basic idea transform pomdp another one additional information provided oracle oracle informs planning agent current state world certain region transformed pomdp consequently said region observable easier solve original pomdp propose solve transformed pomdp use optimal policy construct approximate policy original pomdp controlling amount additional information oracle provides possible find proper tradeoff computational time approximation quality terms algorithmic contributions study details exploit region observability solving transformed pomdp facilitate study also propose new exact algorithm general pomdps algorithm conceptually simple yet significantly efficient previous exact algorithms
