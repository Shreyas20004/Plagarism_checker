title structured variable selection sparsity inducing norms authors rodolphe jenatton jean yves audibert francis bach abstract consider empirical risk minimization problem linear supervised learning regularization structured sparsity inducing norms defined sums euclidean norms certain subsets variables extending usual ell norm group ell norm allowing subsets overlap leads specific set allowed nonzero patterns solutions problems first explore relationship groups defining norm resulting nonzero patterns providing forward backward algorithms go back forth groups patterns allows design norms adapted specific prior knowledge expressed terms nonzero patterns also present efficient active set algorithm analyze consistency variable selection least squares linear regression low high dimensional settings
