title teleo reactive programs agent control authors n nilsson abstract formalism presented computing organizing actions autonomous agents dynamic environments introduce notion teleo reactive r programs whose execution entails construction circuitry continuous computation parameters conditions agent action based addition continuous feedback r programs support parameter binding recursion primary difference r programs many circuit based systems circuitry r programs compact constructed run time thus anticipate contingencies might arise possible runs addition r programs intuitive easy write written form compatible automatic planning learning methods briefly describe experimental applications r programs control simulated actual mobile robots
