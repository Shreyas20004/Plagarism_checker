title hyper sparse optimal aggregation authors st phane ga ffas guillaume lecu abstract paper consider problem hyper sparse aggregation namely given dictionary f f f functions look optimal aggregation algorithm writes tilde f sum j theta j f j many zero coefficients theta j possible problem particular interest f contains many irrelevant functions appear tilde f provide exact oracle inequality tilde f two coefficients non zero entails tilde f optimal aggregation algorithm since selectors suboptimal aggregation procedures proves minimal number elements f required construction optimal aggregation procedures every situations simulated example algorithm proposed dictionary obtained using lars problem selection regularization parameter lasso also give example use aggregation achieve minimax adaptation anisotropic besov spaces previously known minimax theory regression random design
