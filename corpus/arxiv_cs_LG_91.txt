title clustered multi task learning convex formulation authors laurent jacob francis bach jean philippe vert abstract multi task learning several related tasks considered simultaneously hope appropriate sharing information across tasks task may benefit others context learning linear functions supervised classification regression achieved including priori information weight vectors associated tasks expected related paper assume tasks clustered groups unknown beforehand tasks within group similar weight vectors design new spectral norm encodes priori assumption without prior knowledge partition tasks groups resulting new convex optimization formulation multi task learning show simulations synthetic examples iedb mhc binding dataset approach outperforms well known convex methods multi task learning well related non convex methods dedicated problem
