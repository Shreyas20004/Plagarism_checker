title positive factor networks graphical framework modeling non negative sequential data authors brian k vogel abstract present novel graphical framework modeling non negative sequential data hierarchical structure model corresponds network coupled non negative matrix factorization nmf modules refer positive factor network pfn data model linear subject non negativity constraints observation data consisting additive combination individually representable observations also representable network desirable property modeling problems computational auditory scene analysis since distinct sound sources environment often well modeled combining additively corresponding magnitude spectrogram propose inference learning algorithms leverage existing nmf algorithms straightforward implement present target tracking example provide results synthetic observation data serve illustrate interesting properties pfns motivate potential usefulness applications music transcription source separation speech recognition show target process characterized hierarchical state transition model represented pfn results illustrate pfn defined terms single target observation used effectively track states multiple simultaneous targets results show quality inferred target states degrades gradually observation noise increased also present results example meaningful hierarchical features extracted spectrogram hierarchical representation could useful music transcription source separation applications also propose network language modeling
