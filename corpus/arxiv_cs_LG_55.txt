title hmm speaker identification using linear non linear merging techniques authors unathi mahola fulufhelo v nelwamondo tshilidzi marwala abstract speaker identification powerful non invasive expensive biometric technique recognition accuracy however deteriorates noise levels affect specific band frequency paper present sub band based speaker identification intends improve live testing performance frequency sub band processed classified independently also compare linear non linear merging techniques sub bands recognizer support vector machines gaussian mixture models non linear merging techniques investigated results showed sub band based method used linear merging techniques enormously improved performance speaker identification performance wide band recognizers tested live live testing improvement achieved
