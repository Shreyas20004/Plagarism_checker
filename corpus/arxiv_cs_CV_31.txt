title automatic face recognition system based local fourier bessel features authors yossi zana roberto cesar jr regis de barbosa abstract present automatic face verification system inspired known properties biological systems proposed algorithm whole image converted spatial polar frequency domain fourier bessel transform fbt using whole image compared case face image regions local analysis considered resulting representations embedded dissimilarity space image represented distance images pseudo fisher discriminator built verification test results feret database showed local based algorithm outperforms global fbt version local fbt algorithm performed state art methods different testing conditions indicating proposed system highly robust expression age illumination variations also evaluated performance proposed system strong occlusion conditions found highly robust face occlusion finally automated completely verification system implementing face eye detection algorithms condition local approach slightly superior global approach
