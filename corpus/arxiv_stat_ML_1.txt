title metric embedding nearest neighbor classification authors bharath k sriperumbudur gert r g lanckriet abstract distance metric plays important role nearest neighbor nn classification usually euclidean distance metric assumed mahalanobis distance metric optimized improve nn performance paper study problem embedding arbitrary metric spaces euclidean space goal improve accuracy nn classifier propose solution appealing framework regularization reproducing kernel hilbert space prove representer like theorem nn classification embedding function determined solving semidefinite program interesting connection soft margin linear binary support vector machine classifier although main focus paper present general theoretical framework metric embedding nn setting demonstrate performance proposed method benchmark datasets show performs better mahalanobis metric learning algorithm terms leave one generalization errors
