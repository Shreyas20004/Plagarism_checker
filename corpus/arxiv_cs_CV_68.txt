title high order nonparametric belief propagation fast image inpainting authors julian john mcauley tiberio caetano abstract paper use belief propagation techniques develop fast algorithms image inpainting unlike traditional gradient based approaches may require many iterations converge techniques achieve competitive results iterations hand belief propagation techniques often unable deal high order models due explosion size messages avoid problem approximating high order prior model using gaussian mixture using approximation able inpaint images quickly time retaining good visual results
