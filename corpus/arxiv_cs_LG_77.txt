title quadratic loss multi class svm authors emmanuel monfrini yann guermeur abstract using support vector machine requires set two types hyperparameters soft margin parameter c parameters kernel perform model selection task method choice cross validation leave one variant known produce estimator generalization error almost unbiased major drawback rests time requirement overcome difficulty several upper bounds leave one error pattern recognition svm derived among bounds popular one probably radius margin bound applies hard margin pattern recognition svm extension norm svm report introduce quadratic loss svm svm direct extension norm svm multi class case machine generalized radius margin bound established
