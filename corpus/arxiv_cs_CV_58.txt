title multiresolution approximation polygonal curves linear complexity authors pierre fran ois marteau gilbas nier abstract propose new algorithm problem polygonal curve approximation based multiresolution approach algorithm suboptimal still maintains optimality successive levels resolution using dynamic programming show theoretically experimentally algorithm linear complexity time space experimentally compare outcomes algorithm optimal full search dynamic programming solution finally classical merge split approaches experimental evaluations confirm theoretical derivations show proposed approach evaluated coastal maps either show lower time complexity provide polygonal approximations closer input discrete curves
