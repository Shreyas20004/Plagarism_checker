title family simplified geometric distortion models camera calibration authors lili yangquan chen kevin l moore abstract commonly used radial distortion model camera calibration fact assumption restriction practice camera distortion could happen general geometrical manner limited radial sense paper proposes simplified geometrical distortion modeling method using two different radial distortion functions two image axes family simplified geometric distortion models proposed either simple polynomials rational functions polynomials analytical geometric undistortion possible using two distortion functions discussed paper performance improved applying piecewise fitting idea experimental results show geometrical distortion models always perform better radial distortion counterparts furthermore proposed geometric modeling method appropriate cameras whose distortion perfectly radially symmetric around center distortion
