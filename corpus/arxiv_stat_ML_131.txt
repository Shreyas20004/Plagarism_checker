title analysis convergence graph laplacians authors daniel ting ling huang michael jordan abstract existing approaches analyzing asymptotics graph laplacians typically assume well behaved kernel function smoothness assumptions remove smoothness assumption generalize analysis graph laplacians include previously unstudied graphs including knn graphs also introduce kernel free framework analyze graph constructions shrinking neighborhoods general apply analyze locally linear embedding lle also describe given limiting laplacian operator desirable properties convergent spectrum sparseness achieved choosing appropriate graph construction
