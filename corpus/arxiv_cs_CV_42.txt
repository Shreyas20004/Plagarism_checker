title fourier analysis holographic representations signals authors g giraldi b f moutinho l de carvalho j c de oliveira abstract paper focus fourier analysis holographic transforms signal representation instance case image processing holographic representation property arbitrary portion transformed image enables reconstruction whole image details missing focus holographic representation defined fourier transforms thus firstly review results fourier transform fourier series next review discrete holographic fourier transform dhft image representation describe contributions work show simple scheme progressive transmission based dhft next propose continuous holographic fourier transform chft discuss theoretical aspects signals finally testes presented experimental results
