title reconciling synthesis decomposition composite approach capability identification authors ramya ravichandar james arthur robert p broadwater abstract stakeholders expectations technology constantly evolve lengthy development cycles large scale computer based system consequently traditional approach baselining requirements results unsatisfactory system ill equipped accommodate change contrast systems constructed basis capabilities change tolerant capabilities functional abstractions neither amorphous user needs rigid system requirements alternatively capabilities aggregates capture desired functionality users needs designed exhibit desirable software engineering characteristics high cohesion low coupling optimum abstraction levels formulate functional abstractions develop investigate two algorithms capability identification synthesis decomposition synthesis algorithm aggregates detailed rudimentary elements system form capabilities contrast decomposition algorithm determines capabilities recursively partitioning overall mission system detailed entities empirical analysis small computer based library system reveals neither approach sufficient however composite algorithm based complementary approach reconciling two polar perspectives results feasible set capabilities particular composite algorithm formulates capabilities using cohesion coupling measures defined decomposition algorithm abstraction level determined synthesis algorithm
