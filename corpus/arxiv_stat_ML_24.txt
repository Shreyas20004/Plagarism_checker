title persistent clustering theorem j kleinberg authors gunnar carlsson facundo memoli abstract construct framework studying clustering algorithms includes two key ideas persistence functoriality first encodes idea output clustering scheme carry multiresolution structure second idea one able compare results clustering algorithms one varies data set example adding points applying functions show within framework one prove theorem analogous one j kleinberg one obtains existence uniqueness theorem instead non existence result explore properties unique scheme stability convergence established
