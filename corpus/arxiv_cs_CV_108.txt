title keygraph classification framework real time object detection authors marcelo hashimoto roberto cesar jr abstract paper propose new approach keypoint based object detection traditional keypoint based methods consist classifying individual points using pose estimation discard misclassifications since single point carries relational features methods inherently restrict usage structural information pose estimation phase therefore classifier considers purely appearance based feature vectors thus requiring computationally expensive feature extraction complex probabilistic modelling achieve satisfactory robustness contrast approach consists classifying graphs keypoints incorporates structural information classification phase allows extraction simpler feature vectors naturally robust present work vertices graphs considered though methodology general larger order graphs may adopted successful experimental results obtained real time object detection video sequences reported
