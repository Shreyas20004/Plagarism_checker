title mirroring theorem application new method unsupervised hierarchical pattern classification authors dasika ratna deepthi k eswaran abstract paper prove crucial theorem called mirroring theorem affirms given collection samples enough information classified classes subclasses exists mapping classifies subclassifies samples ii exists hierarchical classifier constructed using mirroring neural networks mnns combination clustering algorithm approximate mapping thus proof mirroring theorem provides theoretical basis existence practical feasibility constructing hierarchical classifiers given maps proposed mirroring theorem also considered extension kolmogrovs theorem providing realistic solution unsupervised classification techniques develop general nature led construction learning machines tree like structure ii modular iii module running common algorithm tandem algorithm iv selfsupervised actually built architecture developed tandem algorithm hierarchical classifier demonstrated example problem
