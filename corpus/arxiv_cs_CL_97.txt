title incremental construction minimal acyclic finite state automata authors jan daciuk stoyan mihov bruce watson richard watson abstract paper describe new method constructing minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automata set strings traditional methods consist two phases first construct trie second one minimize approach construct minimal automaton single phase adding new strings one one minimizing resulting automaton fly present general algorithm well specialization relies upon lexicographical ordering input strings
