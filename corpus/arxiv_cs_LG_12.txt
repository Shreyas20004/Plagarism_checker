title reliable efficient inference bayesian networks sparse data statistical learning theory authors dominik janzing daniel herrmann abstract learn statistical dependencies among random variables requires exponentially large sample size number observed random variables arbitrary joint probability distribution occur consider case sparse data strongly suggest probabilities described simple bayesian network e graph small degree delta simple law also explain data high confidence shown calculating bounds vc dimension set probability measures correspond simple graphs allows select networks structural risk minimization gives reliability bounds error estimated joint measure without contrast previous paper prior assumptions set possible joint measures complexity searching optimal bayesian networks degree delta increases polynomially number random varibales constant delta optimal joint measure associated given graph found convex optimization
