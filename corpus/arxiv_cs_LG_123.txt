title equations states statistical learning nonparametrizable regular case authors sumio watanabe abstract many learning machines hierarchical structure hidden variables used information science artificial intelligence bioinformatics however several learning machines used fields regular singular statistical models hence generalization performance still left unknown overcome problems previous papers proved new equations statistical learning estimate bayes generalization loss bayes training loss functional variance condition true distribution singularity contained learning machine paper prove equations hold even true distribution contained parametric model also prove proposed equations regular case asymptotically equivalent takeuchi information criterion therefore proposed equations always applicable without condition unknown true distribution
