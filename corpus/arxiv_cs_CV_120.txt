title new solution relative orientation problem using points vertical direction authors mahzad kalantari amir hashemi franck jung jeanpierre guedon abstract paper presents new method recover relative pose two images using three points vertical direction information vertical direction determined two ways using direct physical measurement like imu inertial measurement unit using vertical vanishing point knowledge vertical direction solves unknowns among parameters relative rotation homologous points requested position couple images rewriting coplanarity equations leads simpler solution remaining unknowns resolution performed algebraic method using grobner bases elements necessary build specific algebraic solver given paper allowing real time implementation results real synthetic data show efficiency method
