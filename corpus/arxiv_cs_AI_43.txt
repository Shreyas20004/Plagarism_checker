title translating horn representations characteristic models authors r khardon abstract characteristic models alternative model based representation horn expressions shown two representations incomparable advantages therefore natural ask cost translating back forth representations interestingly translation questions arise database theory applications design relational databases paper studies computational complexity problems main result two translation problems equivalent polynomial reductions equivalent corresponding decision problem namely translating equivalent deciding whether given set models set characteristic models given horn expression also relate problems hypergraph transversal problem well known problem related applications ai polynomial time algorithm known shown general translation problems least hard hypergraph transversal problem special case equivalent
