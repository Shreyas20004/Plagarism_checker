title dirichlet process mixtures generalized linear models authors lauren hannah david blei warren b powell abstract propose dirichlet process mixtures generalized linear models dp glm new method nonparametric regression accommodates continuous categorical inputs responses modeled generalized linear model prove conditions asymptotic unbiasedness dp glm regression mean function estimate also give examples conditions hold including models compactly supported continuous distributions model continuous covariates categorical response empirically analyze properties dp glm provides better results existing dirichlet process mixture regression models evaluate dp glm several data sets comparing modern methods nonparametric regression like cart bayesian trees gaussian processes compared existing techniques dp glm provides single model corresponding inference algorithms performs well many regression settings
