title model based diagnosis using structured system descriptions authors darwiche abstract paper presents comprehensive approach model based diagnosis includes proposals characterizing computing preferred diagnoses assuming system description augmented system structure directed graph explicating interconnections system components specifically first introduce notion consequence syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence characterizes consistency based diagnoses show standard characterizations diagnoses minimal conflicts correspond syntactic variations consequence second propose new syntactic variation consequence known negation normal form nnf discuss merits compared standard variations third introduce basic algorithm computing consequences nnf given structured system description show system structure contain cycles always linear size consequence nnf computed linear time arbitrary system structures show precise connection complexity computing consequences topology underlying system structure finally present algorithm enumerates preferred diagnoses characterized consequence algorithm shown take linear time size consequence preference criterion satisfies general conditions
