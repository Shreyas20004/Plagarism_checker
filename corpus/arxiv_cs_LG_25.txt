title fpl analysis adaptive bandits authors jan poland abstract main problem follow perturbed leader strategies online decision problems regret bounds typically proven oblivious adversary partial observation cases clear obtain performance guarantees adaptive adversary without worsening bounds propose conceptually simple argument resolve problem using regret bound fpl adversarial multi armed bandit problem shown bound holds common fpl variant using observations designated exploration rounds using observations allows stronger bound matching best bound known far essentially known lower bound adversarial bandits surprisingly variant even need explicit exploration self stabilizing however sampling probabilities either externally provided approximated sufficient accuracy using log samples step
