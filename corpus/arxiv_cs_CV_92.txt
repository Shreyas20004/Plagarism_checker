title conceptualization seeded region growing pixels aggregation part localize final partition invariant seeded region initialisation order authors vincent tariel abstract previous paper conceptualized localization organization seeded region growing pixels aggregation srgpa give issue collision two distinct regions growing process paper propose two implementations manage two classical growing processes one without boundary region region divide regions another unfortunately noticed mehnert jakway partition depends seeded region initialisation order srio propose growing process invariant srio boundary region set ambiguous pixels
