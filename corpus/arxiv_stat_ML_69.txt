title slow slow sfa detects signals slower driving force authors wolfgang konen patrick koch abstract slow feature analysis sfa method extracting slowly varying driving forces quickly varying nonstationary time series show possible sfa detect component even slower driving force e g envelope modulated sine wave shown depends circumstances like embedding dimension time series predictability base frequency whether driving force slower subcomponent detected observe phase transition one regime purpose work quantify influence various parameters phase transition conclude percieved slow sfa varies less fast switching one regime occurs perhaps showing similarity human perception
