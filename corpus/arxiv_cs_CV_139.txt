title multiple pattern classification sparse subspace decomposition authors tomoya sakai abstract robust classification method developed basis sparse subspace decomposition method tries decompose mixture subspaces unlabeled data queries class subspaces possible query classified class whose subspace significantly contributes decomposed subspace multiple queries different classes simultaneously classified respective classes practical greedy algorithm sparse subspace decomposition designed classification present method achieves high recognition rate robust performance exploiting joint sparsity
