title integrative windowing authors j f rnkranz abstract paper investigate windowing rule learning algorithms show contrary previous results decision tree learning windowing fact achieve significant run time gains noise free domains explain different behavior rule learning algorithms fact learn rule independently main contribution paper integrative windowing new type algorithm exploits property integrating good rules final theory right discovered thus avoids learning rules subsequent iterations windowing process experimental evidence variety noise free domains shows integrative windowing fact achieve substantial run time gains furthermore discuss problem noise windowing present algorithm able achieve run time gains set experiments simple domain artificial noise
