title provably bounded optimal agents authors j russell subramanian abstract since inception artificial intelligence relied upon theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality desired property intelligent systems argue others done foundation inadequate imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements result arisen wide gap theory practice ai hindering progress field propose instead property called bounded optimality roughly speaking agent bounded optimal program solution constrained optimization problem presented architecture task environment show construct agents property simple class machine architectures broad class real time environments illustrate results using simple model automated mail sorting facility also define weaker property asymptotic bounded optimality abo generalizes notion optimality classical complexity theory construct universal abo programs e programs abo matter real time constraints applied universal abo programs used building blocks complex systems conclude discussion prospects bounded optimality theoretical basis ai relate similar trends philosophy economics game theory
