title mean field theory meta learning authors dariusz plewczynski abstract discuss mean field theory cellular automata model meta learning meta learning process combining outcomes individual learning procedures order determine final decision higher accuracy single learning method method constructed ensemble interacting learning agents acquire process incoming information using various types different versions machine learning algorithms abstract learning space agents located constructed using fully connected model couples agents random strength values cellular automata network simulates higher level integration information acquired independent learning trials final classification incoming input data therefore defined stationary state meta learning system using simple majority rule yet minority clusters share opposite classification outcome observed system therefore probability selecting proper class given input data estimated even without prior knowledge affiliation fuzzy logic easily introduced system even learning agents build simple binary classification machine learning algorithms calculating percentage agreeing agents
