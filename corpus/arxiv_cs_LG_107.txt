title multi label prediction via compressed sensing authors daniel hsu sham kakade john langford tong zhang abstract consider multi label prediction problems large output spaces assumption output sparsity target label vectors small support develop general theory variant popular error correcting output code scheme using ideas compressed sensing exploiting sparsity method regarded simple reduction multi label regression problems binary regression problems show number subproblems need logarithmic total number possible labels making approach radically efficient others also state prove robustness guarantees method form regret transform bounds general also provide detailed analysis linear prediction setting
