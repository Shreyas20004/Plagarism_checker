title graph rigidity cyclic belief propagation point pattern matching authors julian j mcauley tiberio caetano marconi barbosa abstract recent paper cite caecaeschbar proposed provably optimal polynomial time method performing near isometric point pattern matching means exact probabilistic inference chordal graphical model fundamental result chordal graph question shown globally rigid implying exact inference provides matching solution exact inference complete graphical model implies algorithm optimal noise point patterns paper present new graph also globally rigid advantage graph proposed cite caecaeschbar maximal clique size smaller rendering inference significantly efficient however graph chordal thus standard junction tree algorithms cannot directly applied nevertheless show loopy belief propagation graph converges optimal solution allows us retain optimality guarantee noiseless case substantially reducing memory requirements processing time experimental results show accuracy proposed solution indistinguishable cite caecaeschbar noise point patterns
