title new approach collaborative filtering operator estimation spectral regularization authors jacob abernethy francis bach theodoros evgeniou jean philippe vert abstract present general approach collaborative filtering cf using spectral regularization learn linear operators users objects rate recent low rank type matrix completion approaches cf shown special cases however unlike existing regularization based cf methods approach used also incorporate information attributes users objects limitation existing regularization based cf methods provide novel representer theorems use develop new estimation methods provide learning algorithms based low rank decompositions test standard cf dataset experiments indicate advantages generalizing existing regularization based cf methods incorporate related information users objects finally show certain multi task learning methods also seen special cases proposed approach
