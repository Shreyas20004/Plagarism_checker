title large scale correlation screening authors alfred hero bala rajaratnam abstract paper treats problem screening variables high correlations high dimensional data many fewer samples variables focus threshold based correlation screening methods three related applications screening variables large correlations within single treatment autocorrelation screening screening variables large cross correlations two treatments cross correlation screening screening variables persistently large auto correlations two treatments persistent correlation screening novelty correlation screening identifies smaller number variables highly correlated others compared identifying number correlation parameters correlation screening suffers phase transition phenomenon correlation threshold decreases number discoveries increases abruptly obtain asymptotic expressions mean number discoveries phase transition thresholds function number samples number variables joint sample distribution also show weak dependency condition number discoveries dominated poisson random variable giving asymptotic expression false positive rate correlation screening approach bears tremendous dividends terms type strength asymptotic results obtained also overcomes major hurdles faced existing methods literature correlation screening naturally scalable high dimension numerical results strongly validate theory presented paper illustrate application correlation screening methodology large scale gene expression dataset revealing influential variables exhibit significant amount correlation multiple treatments
