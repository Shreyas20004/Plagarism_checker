title least squares independence regression non linear causal inference non gaussian noise authors makoto yamada masashi sugiyama jun sese abstract discovery non linear causal relationship additive non gaussian noise models attracted considerable attention recently high flexibility paper propose novel causal inference algorithm called least squares independence regression lsir lsir learns additive noise model minimization estimator squared loss mutual information inputs residuals notable advantage lsir existing approaches tuning parameters kernel width regularization parameter naturally optimized cross validation allowing us avoid overfitting data dependent fashion experiments real world datasets show lsir compares favorably state art causal inference method
