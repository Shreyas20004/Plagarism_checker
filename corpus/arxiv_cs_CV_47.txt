title effective edge directed frequency filter removal aliasing upsampled images authors artur rataj abstract raster images range various distortions connected raster structure upsampling might effect substantially yield raster structure original image known aliasing upsampling may introduce aliasing upsampled image well presented method attempts remove aliasing using frequency filters based discrete fast fourier transform applied directionally certain regions placed along edges image opposed anisotropic smoothing methods presented algorithm aims selectively reduce aliasing preserving sharpness image details method used post processing filter along various upsampling algorithms experimentally shown method improve visual quality upsampled images
