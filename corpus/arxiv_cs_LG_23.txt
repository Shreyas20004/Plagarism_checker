title multiresolution kernels authors marco cuturi kenji fukumizu abstract present work new methodology design kernels data structured smaller components text images sequences methodology template procedure applied kernels measures takes advantage detailed bag components representation objects obtain detailed description consider possible decompositions original bag collection nested bags following prior knowledge objects structure consider smaller bags compare two objects detailed perspective stressing local matches smaller bags global coarse perspective considering entire bag multiresolution approach likely best suited tasks coarse approach precise enough subtle mixture local global similarities necessary compare objects approach presented would computationally tractable without factorization trick introduce presenting promising results image retrieval task
