title classification set cover prototype vector machine authors jacob bien robert tibshirani abstract introduce new nearest prototype classifier prototype vector machine pvm arises combinatorial optimization problem cast variant set cover problem propose two algorithms approximating solution pvm selects relatively small number representative points used classification contains nn special case method compatible dissimilarity measure making amenable situations data embedded underlying feature space using non euclidean metric desirable indeed demonstrate much studied zip code data pvm reap benefits problem specific metric example pvm outperforms highly successful nn tangent distance retaining fewer half data points example highlights strengths pvm yielding low error highly interpretable model additionally apply pvm protein classification problem kernel based distance used
