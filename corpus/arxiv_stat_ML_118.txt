title lasso heteroscedasticity authors jinzhu jia karl rohe bin yu abstract performance lasso well understood assumptions standard linear model homoscedastic noise however several applications standard model describe important features data paper examines lasso performs non standard model motivated medical imaging applications applications variance noise scales linearly expectation observation like heteroscedastic models noise terms poisson like model textit independent design matrix specifically paper studies sign consistency lasso sparse poisson like model addition studying sufficient conditions sign consistency lasso estimate paper also gives necessary conditions sign consistency sets conditions comparable results homoscedastic model showing measure signal noise ratio large lasso performs well poisson like data homoscedastic data simulations reveal lasso performs equally well terms model selection performance poisson like data homoscedastic data properly scaled noise variance across range parameterizations taken whole results suggest lasso robust poisson like heteroscedastic noise
