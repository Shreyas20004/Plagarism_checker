title screen learning flat syntactic semantic spoken language analysis using artificial neural networks authors wermter v weber abstract previous approaches analyzing spontaneously spoken language often based encoding syntactic semantic knowledge manually symbolically progress using statistical connectionist language models many current spoken language systems still use relatively brittle hand coded symbolic grammar symbolic semantic component contrast describe called screening approach learning robust processing spontaneously spoken language screening approach flat analysis uses shallow sequences category representations analyzing utterance various syntactic semantic dialog levels rather using deeply structured symbolic analysis use flat connectionist analysis screening approach aims supporting speech language processing using data driven learning robustness connectionist networks order test approach developed screen system based new robust learned flat analysis paper focus detailed description screen architecture flat syntactic semantic analysis interaction speech recognizer detailed evaluation analysis robustness influence noisy incomplete input main result paper flat representations allow robust processing spontaneous spoken language deeply structured representations particular show fault tolerance learning capability connectionist networks support flat analysis providing robust spoken language processing within overall hybrid symbolic connectionist framework
