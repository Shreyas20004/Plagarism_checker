title camera distortion self calibration using plumb line constraint minimal hough entropy authors edward rosten rohan loveland abstract paper present simple robust method self correction camera distortion using single images scenes contain straight lines since common distortion modelled radial distortion illustrate method using harris radial distortion model method applicable distortion model method based transforming edgels distorted image angular hough space optimizing distortion correction parameters minimize entropy corresponding normalized histogram properly corrected imagery fewer curved lines therefore less spread hough space since method rely image structure beyond existence edgels sharing common orientations use edge fitting applicable wide variety image types instance applied equally well images texture weak dominant orientations images strong vanishing points finally method performed synthetic real data revealing particularly robust noise
