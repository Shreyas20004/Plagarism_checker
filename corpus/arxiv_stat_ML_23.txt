title lle low dimensional neighborhood representation authors yair goldberg ya acov ritov abstract local linear embedding algorithm lle non linear dimension reducing technique widely used due computational simplicity intuitive approach lle first linearly reconstructs input point nearest neighbors preserves neighborhood relations low dimensional embedding show reconstruction weights computed lle capture high dimensional structure neighborhoods low dimensional manifold structure consequently weight vectors highly sensitive noise moreover causes lle converge linear projection input opposed non linear embedding goal overcome problems propose compute weight vectors using low dimensional neighborhood representation prove theoretically straightforward computationally simple modification lle reduces lle sensitivity noise modification also removes need regularization number neighbors larger dimension input present numerical examples demonstrating perturbation linear projection problems improved outputs using low dimensional neighborhood representation
