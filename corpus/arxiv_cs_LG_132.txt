title fast search dirichlet process mixture models authors hal daum iii abstract dirichlet process dp mixture models provide flexible bayesian framework density estimation unfortunately flexibility comes cost inference dp mixture models computationally expensive even conjugate distributions used common case one seeks maximum posteriori assignment data points clusters show search algorithms provide practical alternative expensive mcmc variational techniques true posterior sample desired solution found search serve good initializer mcmc experimental results show using techniques possible apply dp mixture models large data sets
