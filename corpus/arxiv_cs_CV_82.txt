title new algorithm interactive structural image segmentation authors alexandre noma ana b v graciano luis augusto consularo roberto cesar jr isabelle bloch abstract paper proposes novel algorithm problem structural image segmentation interactive model based approach interaction expressed model creation done according user traces drawn given input image model input represented means attributed relational graphs derived fly appearance features taken account object attributes structural properties expressed relational attributes cope possible topological differences graphs new structure called deformation graph introduced segmentation process corresponds finding labelling input graph minimizes deformations introduced model updated input information approach shown faster segmentation methods competitive output quality therefore method solves problem multiple label segmentation efficient way encouraging results natural target specific color images well examples showing reusability model presented discussed
