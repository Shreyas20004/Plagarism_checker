title improved heterogeneous distance functions authors r wilson r martinez abstract instance based learning techniques typically handle continuous linear input values well often handle nominal input attributes appropriately value difference metric vdm designed find reasonable distance values nominal attribute values largely ignores continuous attributes requiring discretization map continuous values nominal values paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions called heterogeneous value difference metric hvdm interpolated value difference metric ivdm windowed value difference metric wvdm new distance functions designed handle applications nominal attributes continuous attributes experiments applications new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy average three previous distance functions datasets nominal continuous attributes
