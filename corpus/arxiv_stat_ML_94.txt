title gaussian mixture modeling gaussian process latent variable models authors hannes nickisch carl edward rasmussen abstract density modeling notoriously difficult high dimensional data one approach problem search lower dimensional manifold captures main characteristics data recently gaussian process latent variable model gplvm successfully used find low dimensional manifolds variety complex data gplvm consists set points low dimensional latent space stochastic map observed space show interpreted density model observed space however gplvm trained density model therefore yields bad density estimates propose new training strategy obtain improved generalisation performance better density estimates comparative evaluations several benchmark data sets
