title learning membership functions function based object recognition system authors k woods cook l hall k bowyer l stark abstract functionality based recognition systems recognize objects category level reasoning well objects support expected function systems naturally associate measure goodness membership value recognized object measure goodness result combining individual measures membership values potentially many primitive evaluations different properties object shape membership function used compute membership value evaluating primitive particular physical property object previous versions recognition system known gruff membership function primitive evaluations hand crafted system designer paper provide learning component gruff system called omlet automatically learns membership functions given set example objects labeled desired category measure learning algorithm generally applicable problem low level membership values combined tree structure give final overall membership value
