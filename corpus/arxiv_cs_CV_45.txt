title recognition expression variant faces using masked log gabor features principal component analysis authors vytautas perlibakas abstract article propose method recognition faces different facial expressions recognition extract feature vectors using log gabor filters multiple orientations scales using sliding window algorithm variances based masking features extracted image regions less affected changes facial expressions extracted features passed principal component analysis pca based recognition method results face recognition experiments using expression variant faces showed proposed method could achieve higher recognition accuracy many methods development testing used facial images ar feret databases using facial photographs one thousand persons feret database proposed method achieved first one recognition rate equal error rate eer
