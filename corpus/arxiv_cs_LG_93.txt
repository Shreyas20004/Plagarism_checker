title learning isometric separation maps authors nikolaos vasiloglou alexander g gray david v anderson abstract maximum variance unfolding mvu variants successful embedding data manifolds lower dimensional spaces often revealing true intrinsic dimension paper show also incorporate supervised class information mvu like method without breaking convexity call method isometric separation map show resulting kernel matrix used binary multiclass support vector machine like method semi supervised transductive framework also show method always finds kernel matrix linearly separates training data exactly without projecting infinite dimensional spaces traditional svms choose kernel hope data become linearly separable kernel space paper show hyperplane chosen ad hoc kernel trained data always linearly separable comparisons large margin svms show comparable performance
