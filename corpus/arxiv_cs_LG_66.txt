title relationship posterior optimal similarity authors thomas breuel abstract classification problem described joint density p omega x models p omega eq omega x x bayesian similarity measure shown optimal similarity measure nearest neighbor classification paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties conditional distribution paper first shows reconstruct class labels class posterior distribution p omega x given p omega eq omega x x gives procedure recovering class labels gives asymptotically bayes optimal classification procedure also shows given optimal similarity measure construct classifier outperforms nearest neighbor classifier achieves bayes optimal classification rates paper analyzes bayesian similarity framework classifier faces number related classification tasks multitask learning illustrates reconstruction class posterior distribution possible general finally paper identifies distinct class classification problems using p omega eq omega x x shows using p omega eq omega x x solve problems bayes optimal solution
